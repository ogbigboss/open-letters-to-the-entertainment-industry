In 1973, Roe v. Wade codified abortion rights, and was stricken away in 2022. Many feel this reversal is an example of the country backsliding in terms of gender equality, among other things.

Also in 1973, Homosexuality was delisted from the DSM as a mental disorder. Gender equality is often associated with sexual preference equality, or seen as parallels.

If in 2025 you feel this country is backsliding, how has Rachel Maddow's actions against me not created a playbook for anti gays to pursue Reality Television and showrunning as the next theatre to spread the lie of Gay Conversion Therapy?

GCT didn't have to "succeed" in conversion in order to portray Homosexuality as a mental illness when it isn't. Similarly, you didn't have to "succeed" or fail in any of your pursuits as stated by you (and against my consent) in order to misportray me as something I'm not.

I mean, the weird dream torture thing seems straight (pun intended) out of a GCT horror story. Also the coordinated slander and lies to prevent me from escaping it. Thanks for not electrocuting me, I guess.

I know it seems outlandish, but back in the very recent hey day of the Obama admin, did you really think Roe v. Wade would be reversed? Didn't you think a democratic majority would have prevented that in 2022?

The future is hard to predict. I think Rachel Maddow has made the future a more dangerous one for LGBTQ of all politics, races, ages, and genders by writing a playbook for anti gay millionaires with TV connections to pursue against a backsliding nation.

I ask the LGBTQ community - particularly members of [NBC Out](https://out.nbcuevents.com/), NBC's LGBTQ organization, to organize yourselves against what Maddow is pursuing on NBC's dime with her production on me via her production company, Surprise Inside.

If Maddow hadn't taken this route, perhaps many in this country wouldn't have felt a need to say they "won't go back", only to have made those cries in vain.

I'll come back to this topic later.
