Hello,

Something has recently come to my attention that I hadn't known previously - that in 2022, NBC signed a contract allowing Rachel Maddow to be paid $30m a year in exchange for working 1 day a week at her normal job, allowing her to work 4 days a week as a showrunner to create various types of content.

I hadn't known of her company Surprise Inside productions either until this week.

I'm not sure, but it would make way too much sense that Maddow and Surprise Inside were filming me without my consent. To explain why they'd continue to to this point, perhaps along with many of you, they mistook me for a Maddow fan due to my utilization in some writings of a quote from a Sneaker Pimps song 6 Underground which Maddow famously uses on her show - "Watch this space." I just really like that song - I knew of it before I ever watched Maddow on TV. To borrow another quote from the same song:

"Don't think 'cause I understand, I care; Don't think 'cause I'm talking, we're friends."

No, there is no one on this earth to whom I hold a high enough esteem such that I would sign onto literally anything where they've been non consensually filming me for nearly 3 years. I was trying to be nice by using that quote in my writings as I had the feeling MSNBC had some... knowledge of my situation, but I still cannot confirm that in fact.

I know Maddow is held to a high esteem in liberal and media circles, so I can understand why this situation has persisted despite it's awkwardness, much of which I purposefully manufactured to try and end the situation. No one wants to tell Rachel Maddow she's being uncool - for many involved, it's more awkward than anything I can come up with.

Rachel, if this is you and your production company Surprise Inside, please leave me alone and afterwards repair the damage you've done to my life. You can afford it.

Separately, I've read some quotes from interviews of Rachel from nearly 5 years ago, one with Marc Maron stands out. Maddow describes having depression in "cycles" and also describes having a history of mania, the latter of which as of 2019 was in her words "like one-sixth" of what it used to be, and that her mania used to be even alongside her depression. Could she have been masking her mania in a newsroom career such that she hadn't realized it was occuring, and then in 2022, with a sudden loss of focus in the newsroom, did it possibly come back without her awareness?

Someone with depressive cycles alongside mania is someone with cyclothymia, manic depression, bi polar I or II, or others - mania in cycles is an indicator of more than depression. Maddow does not discuss seeing a therapist, and in other places is clear about not being on medication, saying she manages her depression - though not her mania - with exercise and sleep. I hate to say it, but this experience on my end has always felt like I've been dealing with someone else's mental illness more so than my own. The decision to sleep deprive and psychologically bully me in my dreams via a speaker installed where I sleep has always felt like a rather manic one, particularly since it started a week and a half after I brought up a car theft and likely proved a perjury.

Finally - in 2022, I hadn't realized it, but the people who were listening to me were doing so were well, likely famous due to the Matrix etc. There were probably a lot of people listening to me that a budding showrunner like Maddow would have wanted to connect with. At that time in 2022, I was critical of Maddow's reporting from 2017 concerning hacking from Russia which she equated to the next atomic bomb, but never coalesced into a full story - as a computer programmer, not a hacker, this concerned me and perhaps gave my concerns a certain qualification. Had Maddow known of my saying this, and knew the audience, could hse have felt attacked and felt her showrunning career was threatened, so much so to suborn a perjury to make me and thus anchor anything I say as connected to a lie that would make me look less credible?

It's possible - it would make more sense than a Rashida Jones suborning the perjury, who would feel motivated perhaps to do anything ot keep a Rachel Maddow on the NBC roster and take credit for doing so internally, as Maddow's 2022 contract came only after her hinting at leaving NBC. It's still a fairly reckless thing to do, but recklessness and impulsivity go hand in hand with a manic cycle that may have newly caught up to Maddow given her schedule change as of 2022 allowed her less time to repurpose her mania at the news desk, something she had likely gotten used to.

Anyway, Rachel, if this is you - please stop this. We're all waiting to see if the DOJ / FBI do anything with this, and who knows, they may pass. A Rashida Jones or someone else would have to testify against you as well, if I'm correct, at least with regards to the suborned perjury. Why keep gaslighting me? It's annoying at best and if I could crack, I would've done so already.

This is a plea to, whomever really, to leave me alone, and let's all just wait to see what happens. I'd like to return to a normal life, if even for just a few weeks / months until it gets turned upside down (again) due to an DOJ / FBI investigation into the criminal medical malpractice, fraud, etc.

It's my birthday - if it's not Rachel Maddow, or Surprise Inside productions, could someone just tell whoever it is to leave me alone and wait to see what the Feds do? And if it is Rachel Maddow with Surprise Inside productions - I understand many of you are huge fans of hers, but, could someone tell her to leave me alone, and to see a psychiatrist for the mania?

Also, remember when I said you all could take the "Harvey Weinstein" option here? Please, don't. Don't empower another producer into that type of a position. A difference in gender and / or sexuality is no excuse for this kind of behavior. Though, if I'm wrong, I apologize, of course.
