# Accountability is Power

### Update: 12/26

Perhaps I'm paranoid, but I'm fearing some kind of retaliation from the Democratic party and their media connections for the below outline.

If that is the case, I hope some of you in the industry will finally supply me with the proof of them forcing me through non consensual medical research which was likely criminal medical malpractice and did much harm to my mental health, as well as non consensual reality TV filming, most of which would be illegal in different states under invasion of privacy laws, as without that none of this would have occurred.

I urge you to do this in this case for the better of the country and the party, not just for my personal sake. The country deserves an accurate truth that doesn't get further sullied in attempts to smear me, again.

### An outline

- the matrix, my screen name
  - threatening to establishment liberals - why?
- brief history of liberalism & Neo liberalism, end in Chris Murphy’s recent definition given to NY Mag’s Intelligencer
- Neo liberalism is good for rich entertainers but seen as bad for their fans given how markets function
- markets are good for some, to make them good for all requires accountability
- entertainers have participated in this affair largely to maintain accountability
- This is threatening to liberals because Neo Liberalism lacks accountability

<br />

- legal options to stop Democrat criminal medical malpractice scheme were not pursuable due to democrats being in charge of federal and state offices
- now legal options for accountability are available w/ incoming Trump admin
- entertainers have an opportunity here to make bridges with their MAGA fans without hurting existing relations with liberal fans - crimes were committed, not political opinions, wasn’t all democrats / media types
- Trump was elected in 2016 because this country trusts the voice of an entertainer to hold the forces of globalism and Neo liberalism accountable - opinions on whether he has or not is not relevant to this opportunity

<br />

- New Neo Liberalism: Make America Accountable Again
 - restate Murphy’s definition of neoliberalism
  - Neo liberalism is good for rich entertainers but seen as bad for their fans given how markets function
- markets are good for some, to make them good for all requires accountability
- unaccountable leadership is what makes Neo liberalism bad, markets are predators for your fans in so much that leadership can be predators in non economic ways - weird criminal shit begets global economic criminal shit
  - stop predators in leadership positions by becoming the new face of American accountability, this will allow the avenue to hold markets accountable for where they are bad for your fans

<br />

- Again, Trump was elected in 2016 because Americans see leadership in entertainers that doesn’t exist within politics
- Entertainers can fill the power vacuum that exists in this country’s lack of accountability starting with the Democratic Party to which you already have heavy influence - make that influence control, make that influence power, grow that power
- Don’t just wag the finger at the other side, lead by example
- Nothing creates power like a new force holding an old establishment accountable for criminal behavior
  - this was essentially the founding father’s whole thing vs. King George
  - the entertainment industry can be the leaders of America by taking this opportunity to hold power accountable to the crimes you’ve witnessed
- Fulfill the spirit of Hollywood, of pop music, hip hop, rock n roll, of multi generational youth culture as a movement to hold the powerful accountable with the truth; do that by taking this once in a millennia opportunity these democrats have given to the leaders of movies, music, and media with the crimes they’ve allowed you to witness

<br />
  
- This is what threatens the establishment liberals which sought criminal behaviors against me because of the whole Matrix thing - I kept making them look foolish for abusing the law and the media to pursue me, but I only did that because it’s the closest I can get as one person to holding them accountable for fascist behavior - they fear accountabliity, thus why the escalated knowing I had a Hollywood audience due to the Matrix thing
- what you do with that power after it’s taken by holding the democrats accountable is up to you
- Midterms in 2 years, another presidential election in 4 - getting this done sooner clears an avenue to a brighter, less criminal future for the Democratic Party
- Delaying it / avoiding it risks exposure in later years or decades and may make you seem complicit for criminal behavior AND to blame for whatever problems occur in America’s future - who knows what a stronger, less criminal Democratic Party could have achieved?
  - manage the image of complicity now by being the ones that hold those that executed this accountable - you didn’t do that, you didn’t know what to say, it got out of hand, maybe you kept saying to stop and they didn’t, you’re glad it’s coming to light now though - they’re not going to say you had fun with it too, that would be childish to hide behind
- if you don’t take this opportunity, whatever else negative happens to America will be shaped by it without your control and to your blame - what could have happened if you spoke out?
- if you take this opportunity, whatever else positive happens to America will be in your control and to your credit - change only can happen if you speak out
